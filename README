smb is a chatroom for multi user systems

boards are spawned with ./smb -C and can contain arbitrarily many rooms

unless the -pwd flag or a complete file path is provided, 
./smb -C [board_name] will create a .smbr file in /var/tmp/board_name.smbr

the smb client will first search the current directory before checking
/var/tmp for a matching board file

the host does not store messages and does nothing more than reroute messages
beteen clients

usage:
      ./smb {-[a]ny} {-[p]wd} {-[d]ur [hours]} {-C} [board_name] - creates or joins a board with name [board_name]

-C indicates create only mode
if board does not exist, even if -C is not passed, it is created

if the -pwd flag is set, the scope of smb's board creation
and searching is limited to the current working directory

if the -any flag is set, the first board that is found will be joined

if the -dur flag is used to set a board time limit, the board will be
removed after [hours] hours - otherwise, board will last for 5 days
