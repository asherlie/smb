smb is a chatroom for multi user systems

boards are spawned with ./smb -C and can contain arbitrarily many rooms

unless the -pwd flag or a complete file path is provided, 
./smb -C [board_name] will create a .smbr file in /var/tmp/board_name.smbr

the smb client will first search the current directory before checking
/var/tmp for a matching board file

the host does not store messages and does nothing more than reroute messages
beteen clients

usage:
      ./smb {-[p]wd} -C [board_name] - creates a board with name [board_name]
      ./smb {-[p]wd}    [board_path] - joins board at path [board_path]

the -pwd flag limits the scope of smb's board creation and board searching to
the current working directory

client commands:

      [message]:
            sends message to current room

      /[h]elp:
            prints this information

      /[j]oin  [room_name]:
      /[r]room [room_name]:
            join room with room_name

      /[n]ext:
            switch to next room with same first char as current

      /[c]reate [room_name]:
            creates a room with name room_name

      /[l]ist:
            lists all rooms, current room will be blue

      /[w]hich:
            prints current room name and reference number

      /[e]xit:
      /e[x]it:
            exits current room

[ROOM_CREATE]   indicates that a new room has been created
[*ROOM_CREATE*] indicates that a room whose creation predates your
                joining of the board has been shared with you -
                the sharing of rooms happens automatically when a
                message is sent in a previously unknown board
